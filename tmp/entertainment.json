The Times says it is unlikely that the 45-year-old presenter will continue in his role as host following the accident at the Top Gear test track at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey, last December. A Top Gear insider reportedly told The Times : \"Freddie has been seriously emotionally and physically affected by the crash. He is a daredevil, that's what he does, and he doesn't feel like he is able to continue to play that role on the show.\" Flintoff was airlifted to hospital with facial injuries and broken ribs after the car he was driving flipped over. Filming on the series was suspended while he recovered from his injuries and investigations took place, and yesterday (Thursday March 23) the BBC confirmed it had apologised to the presenter as it announced its decision not to resume filming of the series.

With reports saying that his family begged him to stay away from work while he recovered, a source told The Times: \"Freddie has been seriously emotionally and physically affected by the crash. He is a daredevil, that's what he does, and he doesn't feel like he is able to continue to play that role on the show.\" At the time of the crash, his 16-year-old son Corey told the Daily Mail : \"He is lucky to be alive. It was a pretty nasty crash. It is shocking. We are all shocked but just hope he's going to be okay.\" In a statement, the BBC said: yesterday: \"We have sincerely apologised to Freddie and will continue to support him with his recovery. We understand this [halting the show] will be disappointing for fans, but it is the right thing to do, and we'll make a judgment about how best to continue later this year.\" Subscribe here for the latest news where you live Top Gear had been running under different presenters since 2002 and was one of the broadcaster's most successful and exported programmes. Flintoff had previously crashed into a market stall in Mansfield while filming in February 2019 and a few months later crashed during a drag race at Elvington Airfield in Yorkshire. In both cases he walked away with only minor injuries.

The 32-year-old chart-topping singer recently spoke about suffering with his mental health after his wife was diagnosed with a tumour and his close friend Jamal Edwards died. After originally writing Eyes Closed as a break-up track, Sheeran revisited the song after experiencing personal loss and discovered the lyrics took on “a whole new meaning”. Speaking about the new song, Sheeran said: “This song is about losing someone, feeling like every time you go out and you expect to just bump into them, and everything just reminds you of them and the things you did together. “You sort of have to take yourself out of reality sometimes to numb the pain of loss, but certain things just bring you right back into it.” Earlier this month Sheeran revealed that his wife, Cherry Seaborn, who he married in 2019, was told by doctors she had a tumour while pregnant with their second child, who was born in May 2022. Sheeran said our whole world was turned upside down when Jamal Edwards died Music entrepreneur Edwards, who founded the music platform SBTV in 2006 that helped launch Sheeran’s career, died in February last year at the age of 31. Sheeran explained the idea behind the Eyes Closed official music video, which was directed by Mia Barnes and sees Sheeran being followed by a blue monster, serving as a metaphor for grief. “When I was thinking of concepts for the Eyes Closed music video, I wanted to make a video inspired by movies like Harvey, where the main character has an imaginary friend who’s a giant rabbit that no-one can see,” said Sheeran. “There’s also a book I read my daughters where sadness is encapsulated by an imaginary creature. Often sadness is something that follows you around, engulfing the rooms you’re in, and you can feel and see it, but no-one else around you can. “So, I decided to create my own big blue monster for the video. He gets bigger and bigger as the video goes on, until he takes up whole rooms, and is all I can see, just like sadness.” Sheeran’s sixth studio album called – (the mathematical symbol for subtract), is billed for release on May 5 and will feature 14 tracks written and recorded with The National’s Aaron Dessner in February last year. While creating the album Sheeran and Dessner, who collaborated on Taylor Swift’s lockdown records Folklore and Evermore, wrote more than 30 songs during a month of studio time. Subtract is the latest instalment in Sheeran’s mathematical symbol series, which has progressed through albums including = (Equals) and ÷ (Divide). A portrait shot to accompany Eyes Closed has been taken by acclaimed US photographer Annie Leibovitz.

Owens, 33, showed the SKIMS ad on her show featuring a model in a wheelchair, before adding, 'I don’t really understand how far we’re going to take this inclusivity thing. I really don’t get it. I don’t know. If I’m wrong, again, educate me, today. I just want to be educated in the comments. Why did they do this? I don’t know, I don’t know why this needs to be done. I’m just getting tired of this all-inclusivity thing. It seems ridiculous. She added, 'Look, I assume that people who’re in wheelchairs also have to buy bras, also have to buy underwear…I didn’t know that we needed to see that in our face. I didn’t know that now we’re going to have to look forward to campaigns where women who are in wheelchairs are now wearing bras and underwear because we as a society cannot get to the bottom of our ridiculousness.' Applegate - who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2021 and revealed that the SAG Awards in February might have been her final awards show due to her struggles with MS - took to Twitter on early Thursday morning to share her thoughts about Owens' comments. 'Yes late tweet.But woke to see the most horrifying thing. This Candace person making comments about companies who see we need help. It’s f***ing gross,' Applegate said.

But always gotta call out a person who needs to see She will wake in the morning and her heart will hurt and hopefully she will change. All we can hope for.' The Married With Children star also responded to a fan who said she also needs, 'clothing like this,' telling her to, 'Just Google accessibility lines. It’s all new. The fashion industry is trying. With the shoes you can slip into to cosmetics.' The actress later tweeted, 'Going to try and sleep but my rage is keeping me awake,' before enlightening Owens about her struggles. 'Candace Owens, do you know when you have seen pictures of me how f***ing hard it was to get my clothes on? A team has to help me!!! So I’m excited for accessibility clothing for me and my community. Hope u wake,' Applegate said. She then reached out to Owens, stating she'd be willing to talk with her if that's what she wanted, perhaps since she did say on her show, 'If I'm wrong, educate me.' 'I thought my last tweet was enough. But then my heart said something else. No rage. If Candace wants to get on the phone with me to be educated on being disabled. I will not come with anger.

'We actually did not know that this particular ad featured a specific technology designed for people with disabilities, which was an honest mistake,' Owens admitted. She added in another tweet, 'What we thought it was at the time, was another nonsensical “representation matters” DEI initiative which I strongly feel patronizes the people it purports to represent. (Example: clinically obese people modeling swimsuits). This wasn’t that and we simply got it wrong.' 'We create a show 5 days a week. It is an impossibility that we would not at some point make an honest mistake. If you felt personally targeted by this mistake, I apologize to you. We simply did not know (the ad did not state) that the underwear was created for disabled access,' Owens concluded. While Applegate did not personally respond to Owens' tweets, it seems clear she read them, seemingly addressing them in another tweet featuring an image of the ad that started it all on Thursday afternoon. 'Thank you @SKIMS for showing how beautiful the disabled community is And for your adaptive line for those of us with mobility issues. Not sure how you could not appreciate this and think it was an “honest mistake,\"' Applegate said. The actress took her 12-year-old daughter Sadie Grace LeNoble to the 2023 Screen Actors Guild Awards in late February, where she was nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series for her role in Netflix's Dead to Me. She arrived at the ceremony and walked the red carpet with her daughter while carrying a black cane that featured, 'FU MS' written on the bottom. Applegate told the Los Angeles Times that this would be her 'last awards show as an actor probably, so it's kind of a big deal.' 'Right now, I couldn't imagine getting up at 5 a.m. and spending 12 to 14 hours on a set; I don't have that in me at this moment,' she explained.

Alison, 48, will host the Channel 4 favourite alongside Noel Fielding, after Matt Lucas stepped down. Despite her experience presenting on This Morning's Friday shows alongside Dermot O'Leary, Alison still had to show Bake Off bosses she could rise to the challenge and was worth the dough. The star had to interview members of the public in a garden centre to show off her people skills. Luckily, she had practice, having reported from a similar venue in 2020 for This Morning. She told The Sun: “They made me interview random strangers, to obviously see if I’m good with different people. It was a weird audition.” The former Strictly star said she had to keep her new role secret for three weeks, but did tell her son Aiden, 18. Confirming the news of her new role on Twitter, Alison tweeted: “It’s Official!! It’s happening The Great British Bake off! let’s have it – The cake that is so excited @BritishBakeOff @Channel4 @PrueLeith @PaulHollywood @noelfielding11 #GBBO.“ Matt revealed in December he was stepping down from the presenting role after appearing in the past three series as he could no longer commit to the programme’s schedule alongside his other projects. The comedian reposted Hammond’s announcement video to Twitter and wrote: “Dear Alison, many congratulations! You were born to do it. You will be brilliant! Xx.“ Meanwhile, Noel posted a photo of his new co-host on his Instagram, writing: “It gives me so much pleasure to welcome @alisonhammond55 into the tent. I’m absolutely pumped we are working together. “We are gonna spend the whole time giggling like naughty school kids.

Going up against James Blunt, Alex Jones and Joe Sugg, she declared: “I do think that good food and good baking comes from the heart - and I’ve got a lot of heart.” Exuding confidence right from the start, she told judges Paul Hollywood and Dame Prue Leith: “I love chocolate brownies. Any time I go out and about, try a brownie, it never compares to my brownies. I know that sounds really big headed.” The TV star’s career was launched in 2002, when she became the second housemate to be evicted from the third series of Big Brother. Over the past 20 years Alison has also appeared as a contestant on several other shows including Celebrity MasterChef in 2006, I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here in 2010 and Strictly Come Dancing in 2014.

In a first for the show, builder Paul Foreman (Ash) will be diagnosed with the terminal disease next month. He will be given a referral to a specialist in tonight's (Friday, March 24) episode, after weeks of speculation about what has been causing the much-loved character's clumsiness. MND is a fatal, rapidly progressing disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, attacking the nerves that control movement so muscles no longer work and currently it has no cure. Experts from the MND Association have been advising the soap's researchers, scriptwriters and actors since last autumn to ensure an “accurate portrayal”. The storyline will follow the challenges Paul faces as he loses his mobility, and his ability to eat and speak, “locked in a body that is failing”. Talking about portraying the physical effects of the illness, 38-year-old Ash said: “I’ve been eased into it. “It started with Paul’s hand but I’m very aware as the time goes on and as the symptoms progress, it’ll get a lot more technical. So I’m sure as the symptoms pile up, I’m going to be speaking a lot more with the MND Association to make sure we get it all right. It’s quite a journey that he’ll be going on.” He added: “Especially when you’re playing a character with an illness or a condition, there’s so much responsibility to get it right, not to cheapen it and to represent it properly. We act it but there are people watching who are living with it so it’s very important to get it right and be spot on with it, be sensitive.” Ash said he was initially shocked to discover the future of his character because the nature of the disease will mean his exit from the show. “I’ll be sad to leave the show, it’s been an amazing job, I’ve met fantastic people. But also at the same time, happy to be involved in such a powerful storyline that hopefully will bring awareness,” he said. Ash added that he originally knew about the disease only through Professor Stephen Hawking, but has since read former rugby player Rob Burrow’s book and watched his documentary to understand more about the illness. The ITV storyline will follow the impact the diagnosis has on Paul's loved ones, including his boyfriend Billy Mayhew, played by Daniel Brocklebank. The 43-year-old actor, whose grandfather died of MND 20 years ago, said his own experiences of the disease will directly translate into his acting. Brocklebank, who is an MND ambassador, said: “They told me what the storyline was going to be but they had no idea of my history with MND or with the association, so it was a bit of a shock. My legs went a little bit weak because I suppose it just brings back memories of that time. I did wonder if this could potentially be quite triggering in a lot of ways.

Producer Iain MacLeod said: “A show like Coronation Street is uniquely placed to show the day-to-day reality of dealing with an illness that gradually and progressively erodes the physical attributes that you perhaps take for granted, changing forever the way you interact with the world around you. “At first Paul – who as a builder relies entirely on his physicality for his livelihood – will massively go off the rails in a misplaced bid to ensure he isn’t a burden on his loved ones. But in the end, they will be the ones to put him back together emotionally. \"We are committed to portraying in a long-term, sensitive way the effects of this condition on Paul and his family and friends, not shying away from the sometimes painful reality of what his life will be like.” Chris James, director of external affairs at the MND Association, said: “We are really grateful to the team at Coronation Street for choosing to tackle this subject. Putting MND in front of six million viewers every week will raise incredible awareness and help educate people who have never come across the disease, showing the day-to-day reality of those living with it and the impact on friends, family and the wider community.” For more stories from where you live, visit InYourArea.","pubDate":"2023-03-24 02:17:21","image_url":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/news/article26547166.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_271490473.jpg","id":"5dbc8483-ff46-410a-86f4-573d2361b8af"},{"title":"Hình ảnh 'trước và sau drama' của ông Nawat khi đến Việt Nam: Vắng fan, chủ tịch cười sượng?","link":"https://docbao.vn/giai-tri/hinh-anh-truoc-va-sau-drama-cua-ong-nawat-khi-den-viet-nam-vang-fan-chu-tich-cuoi-suong-tintuc870184","description":"Cứ ngỡ ông Nawat không ai đưa rước tại sân bay Việt Nam hậu drama với Hoa hậu Thiên Ân, nhưng tình thế lại trái ngược hoàn toàn.","content":"Chiều ngày 23/3, Chủ tịch Hoa hậu Hòa bình Quốc tế - Itsaragrisil cùng dàn \"chiến binh\" Miss Grand Thailand có mặt tại sân bay để khảo sát các công đoạn đầu tiên cho khâu tổ chức của Miss Grand International 2023 được diễn ra vào cuối tháng 10 năm nay. Hậu ồn ào với Hoa hậu Thiên Ân, ông Nawat và thương hiệu Miss Grand không còn nhận được nhiều sự ủng hộ tại Việt Nam. Nhiều người dự đoán rằng, chuyến công du lần này của vị chủ tịch tại Việt Nam sẽ không được nghênh tiếp nồng nhiệt như trước đây. Tuy nhiên, sự thật lại trái với những gì cõi mạng bàn tán, hàng loạt người hâm mộ đã trực tiếp đến sân bay Tân Sơn Nhất cùng với băng rôn, hình ảnh, sổ sách - bút viết để giao lưu với đoàn Miss Grand của ông Nawat. Nếu so sánh về số lượng người hâm mộ đón tiếp ông Nawat ở hiện tại với giai đoạn trước khi xảy ra \"drama\", thì vẫn không thể huy hoàng bằng. Có thể nói, sau sự việc đáng tiếc với Thiên Ân lẫn người hâm mộ Việt, ông Nawat không còn nhận được quá nhiều tình cảm từ phía fan Việt. Thậm chí, nhiều anti-fan đã tấn công vào trang cá nhân của vị chủ tịch sinh năm 1973 để yêu cầu ông không đến Việt Nam. Nguồn cơn drama bắt đầu từ giai đoạn tháng cuối tháng 10/2022, Thiên Ân - đại diện Việt Nam tại Miss Grand International 2022 bị loại khỏi Top 10 chung cuộc. Fan sắc đẹp Vbiz đã đồng loạt bỏ theo dõi trang chủ cuộc thi này vì cho rằng ông Nawat thiên vị Engfa Waraha và đại diện Campuchia. Tiếp đó, vị chủ tịch liên tục livestream để nói về vấn đề này, đồng thời ông cho rằng Thiên Ân xứng đáng dừng ở Top 20, vì cô nàng là thí sinh duy nhất có \"phần thân trên dài hơn thân dưới, phần hông to\". Dẫn đến, cơn sóng tẩy chay ông Nawat và Miss Grand International càng trở nên lớn mạnh tại Việt Nam.","pubDate":"2023-03-24 02:06:55","image_url":"//img.docbao.vn/2023/03/24/nawat-5.png","id":"1570b11e-30ea-4166-a9c6-5c04eddf1524"},{"title":"Michelle Rodriguez and Rege-Jean Page attend the Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves UK premiere","link":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11896003/Michelle-Rodriguez-Rege-Jean-Page-attend-Dungeons-Dragons-Honor-Thieves-UK-premiere.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","description":"Michelle Rodriguez and Rege-Jean Page dressed to impress on Thursday night as they led the star-studded arrival as at the UK premiere of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.","content":"Michelle Rodriguez looks glam in a black off-the-shoulder gown while Rege-Jean Page goes shirtless beneath a smart charcoal suit as they attend the UK premiere of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves By Niomi Harris For Mailonline Published: 15:46 EDT, 23 March 2023 | Updated: 21:52 EDT, 23 March 2023 e-mail 18 View comments Advertisement Michelle Rodriguez and Rege-Jean Page dressed to impress on Thursday night as they led the star-studded arrival as at the UK premiere of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.

WBC heavyweight champion Tyson, 34, took to his Instagram stories on Thursday evening to confirm the baby news with a sweet photo of the married couple on a \"date night\". Paris, 33, and Tyson already have six children; Venezuela, 14, Prince John James 10, Prince Tyson Fury II, five, Valencia Amber, four, Prince Adonis Amaziah, three, and one-year-old Athena. The couple have been together since they were teenagers and tied the knot in 2008. But he proudly announced child number seventh was on its way with the cute post. He said: \"I get to do date night with my beautiful pregnant wife Paris, Gods is great. Seventh baby incoming, fantastic news to cheer me up.\" How Paris Fury hid her pregnancy as husband Tyson reveals they are having a seventh child Paris confirmed the baby news by reposting Tyson's Instagram Stories ( Image: tysonfury/Instagram) Recent posts have seen her share headshots or not feature in the photos at all ( Image: Instagram) Paris uploaded the same post from Tyson's Instagram Stories on to her own grid for her 1 million followers to see. The Loose Women panellist wrote: \"Baby NO 7 on the way God willing,\" followed by a praying hands emoji. Hundreds flocked to the comments section to send their congratulations, including former Love Island star Molly-Mae Hague who recently became a mum herself for the first time last month. Molly-Mae, who is dating Tyson's younger half-brother Tommy , replied: \"What a blessing. So happy for you both!\" The married couple already have six children aged between 14 and one ( Image: Top Rank via Getty Images) Rumours of a seventh child between the power couple has circulated since New Year's Eve when Paris and Tyson posed by their Christmas tree as they prepared to enter 2023. Paris looked stunning in a red dress and matching heels while Tyson rocked a floral shirt and jeans combinations as they posed for the camera, with the boxer putting a protective hand on her stomach. She tried to stop the speculation before it began with her caption, which read: \"Had a great Christmas and some lovely family filled days. (PS Tysons hand is just there don’t start rumours).\" Paris tried to dismiss pregnancy rumours on New Year's Eve ( Image: Instagram) Most recently, she shared a photo of her brood for youngest son Adonis' fourth birthday ( Image: Instagram) Since that post on December 31, Paris has restricted herself to top-half only snaps apart from on Valentine's Day when the couple enjoyed a romantic meal. She has since posted a selfie of her in a car, wearing a seatbelt, with the caption: \"Whatever is good for your soul, do that!\" Paris was not in the shot at all as she shared a cute family photo on March 1 to celebrate the fourth birthday of youngest son Adonis. All of the Fury's brood were in the snap apart from eldest daughter Venezuela and mum Paris. *Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter and Facebook .

World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said that the decision to exclude transgender women who had gone through male puberty was based “on the overarching need to protect the female category”. The tighter measures around one of the most contentious and divisive issues in sport follow a similar move by World Aquatics in 2022. World Athletics’ council also voted to cut the maximum amount of plasma testosterone for athletes with Differences in Sex Development (DSD) in half, to 2.5 nanomoles per liter from five. DSD athletes will also have to reduce their testosterone levels below the new limit for a minimum of 24 months across all events to compete, double the previous time. The governing body had previously floated the option of transgender athletes being allowed to compete in the female category if they, too, maintained testosterone levels below 2.5 nanomoles per liter for 24 months. Yet it said on Thursday that it became apparent there was little support within the sport for that proposal. “We’re not saying no forever,” Coe told a news conference. Coe announced the formation of a working group, which will be chaired by a transgender athlete, to further study the issue of trans inclusion. “The working group will look at any prevailing or changing or furthering of our understanding in that space,” Coe said. “We don’t know enough, we now need to know more, and that is the journey that we’re on. But we weren’t prepared to risk the female category on that basis.” The tighter t estosterone rules will impact DSD athletes such as two-times Olympic 800 meter champion Caster Semenya, Christine Mboma, the 2020 Olympic silver medalist in the 200m, and Francine Niyonsaba, who finished runner-up to Semenya in the 800 at the 2016 Olympics. WA regulations around DSD previously required women competing in events between 400 meters and a mile to maintain testosterone levels below five nanomoles per liter. The governing body on Thursday introduced interim provisions for athletes already competing outside the restricted events, who will be required to suppress their testosterone level to 2.5 nanomoles per liter for six months. This would prevent several women from competing at the World Athletics Championships in August. Since being barred from the 800m, Burundi’s Niyonsaba turned her attention to the 5,000, winning the Diamond League Final in 2021. She was disqualified in her heat of the 5,000m at the Tokyo Olympics for a lane violation, while Semenya failed to qualify for the G ames. Namibia’s Mboma, prevented from running the 400m, switched to the 200m, winning silver in Tokyo . DSD athletes have male testes but do not produce enough of the hormone Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that is necessary for the formation of male external genitalia. C oe said the decisions were made in consultation with numerous stakeholders including 40 member federations, coaches, athletes, plus a range of community groups including trans groups, United Nations experts and the International Olympic Committee. Swimming’s world governing body World Aquatics voted last June to bar transgender women from elite competition if they had experienced any part of male puberty. A scientific panel had found that even after reducing their testosterone levels through medication, transgender women still had a significant advantage. Tha t vote passed with 71% of the national federations in favor. —Reporting by Lori Ewing; Editing by Toby Davis","pubDate":"2023-03-24 01:12:38","image_url":"https://media.interaksyon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/women-athletes-300x200.jpg","id":"f2fae1fb-add6-4681-ae1e-aa657626c7e0"},{"title":"Lee Do Hyun Is Unrecognizably Different After An Unexpected Accident In “The Good Bad Mother”","link":"https://www.soompi.com/article/1574837wpp/lee-do-hyun-is-unrecognizably-different-after-an-unexpected-accident-in-the-good-bad-mother","description":"JTBC’s upcoming drama “The Good Bad Mother” has unveiled its main posters! “The Good Bad Mother” is a heartwarming new comedy about a woman who must return to her motherly duties after her adult son unexpectedly becomes like a young child again.

Ra Mi Ran will star as Young Soon, a single mom who was widowed at a young age and raised her son Kang Ho ( Lee Do Hyun ) by herself while running a pig farm. Because she didn’t want her son to grow up penniless or powerless, Young Soon chose to become a “bad mother” by constantly being hard on her son and taking the “tough love” approach in raising him. Thanks to Young Soon’s merciless discipline, Kang Ho has no choice but to live his life exactly the way his mother wants, and he grows up to become a prominent prosecutor with a cold personality and a hidden secret. In his relentless quest for success, Kang Ho even turns his back on his mother—but when he loses his memory due to an unfortunate accident, he returns home after reverting to his seven-year-old self. The newly released posters offer a glimpse of the stark contrast between Kang Ho before and after the accident. On one side of the poster, Kang Ho glares at the camera with an intimidating poker face that hints at his frosty demeanor as a prosecutor. But on the other side, he couldn’t be more different: after the accident, Kang Ho wears an innocent smile and exudes a cheerful, happy-go-lucky vibe. Meanwhile, Young Soon—who stands between the two polar-opposite versions of her son—looks troubled as she visibly struggles with conflicting emotions. Although she is overwhelmed with guilt, it is her guilt that drives her to ultimately make a difficult choice: for the sake of Kang Ho’s recovery, Young Soon makes up her mind to become a “bad mother” once again. One poster caption reads, “I’ll become a bad mom one more time,” while the other cryptically reads, “All the moms in the world are bad.” The producers of “The Good Bad Mother” teased, “Please look forward to finding out what the decisive accident is that irrevocably changes Young Soon’s and Kang Ho’s lives, as well as Ra Mi Ran’s and Lee Do Hyun’s passionate acting as they portray the changes in the mother-son duo in fine detail.” “At the end of their misfortune, the two characters will begin to find happiness,” they continued. “Their special journey will include both fun laughs and touching moments that will make you tear up.” “The Good Bad Mother” will premiere on April 26 at 10:30 p.m. KST.

Jordan, 28, and Zara, 25, both appeared on the latest series of the ITV2 programme, though they didn't actually meet in the villa as they were on the show at different times. It was later revealed, following their respective returns to the UK from South Africa, that they had started dating.

A fan wrote on Twitter earlier this week that Jordan had alleged on TikTok recently that him and Zara had \"agreed to fake the relationship\". The social media user tweeted about Zara: \"She is yet to respond to Jordan's accusation of planned breakup. \"If it was a planned relationship and she came out to make him look bad, then she is more evil than I thought she was and I am really waiting for her to say its a lie\". When someone else mentioned that Zara had posted about red flags before announcing the 'break-up', the person responded in reference to Jordan: \"Exactly what I am saying, but the boy went on tiktok after to say, they agreed to fake the relationship or whatever you call 2 and half weeks\". A spokesperson for Jordan however has told the Mirror that no such TikTok post ever existed. The spokesperson added: \"Jordan has stated officially [that] no such TikTok has ever been made\".

Its protagonist is former homicide detective Roy Freeman (Crowe), who in the wake of a cutting-edge Alzheimer’s treatment, is tasked with re-examining a brutal murder case from his past — the grisly murder of a college professor (Csokas). Intrigued and fighting to regain his memory, Roy enlists his former partner to help him revive the investigation.

In short, it shouldn't impact the output of the studio at all.\n\n“Part of the raison d'etre behind the deal was that Atari's vision for Nightdive is: ‘we want you guys to keep on doing what you have been doing, only do more of it.’\n\nCheck out the trailer for System Shock.\n\n“So it should not be unexpected or surprising to anyone, but a lot of the deals that happen in the gaming industry are based on personal relationships, right? We have known Wade Rosen, the relatively new CEO of Atari, for a number of years. Wade is the only external investor in Nightdive Studios.”\n\n“We have worked with Wade but we also know him on a personal basis and that was a lot of the impetus of finding a like mind. But [someone] that also had a complimentary skill set that would allow us to really extend our vision and mission.”\n\nOn the topic of whether this would affect the games Nightdive could work on in the future. Kuperman insisted this wasn't the case: \"No, and some of our external relationships have been fully disclosed publicly as great relationships. Like our time working with Bethesda! That's something that we anticipate will continue going on into the future and, you know, perhaps doing more of it.\"\n\nWhile Kuperman ensured that the Atari deal would not lead to a shift in strategy, nor a change in the kinds of games Nightdive would release, he did state that the deal may open up channels the studio has not been able to explore. He'd continue by pointing to Nightdive's history, initially starting on PC before partnering with Xbox for console releases, later expanding to Nintendo Switch and Playstation. He'd also point out: \"I don't think people necessarily know this, but quite a bit of our business comes from the Playstation side of things\"\n\nAs for the 50 / 50 split between cash and Atari stocks being the price for the Nightdive Acquisition, Kuperman stated this was sought after by both sides. \"One of the reasons why the stock portion of it was so important is that we are invested - in every sense of the word invested - in the future growth of Atari. This means the success of Atari will be beneficial to us, and vice versa for sure.\"\n\nFinally, why now? With System Shock on the horizon and numerous eyes on the studio's immediate future, go through this massive business venture? Well, sccording to Kuperman, its specifically because System Shock is nearly done that this deal was able to happen.\n\n\"System shock is something that has occupied so much of our focus.\"\n\n\"But until we’d reached this point where the end goal is in sight for us, we just did not have the resources to look at this kind of deal. First of all, if people have never been through an acquisition, and especially by a publicly traded company, they don't realise the complexity involved in it. I don't want to say that I've had to give them blood samples, but pretty close. (laughs). They certainly have done their due diligence and are aware that, you know, they're no skeletons in this closet. But you know, it really is draining and it really is all consuming.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Atari x Nightdive Studios deal will lead both companies to greener pastures, but with the imminent launch of System Shock on the horizon, the sudden announcement of the aquisition has certainly thrown a curveball at the interested public. Perhaps this is the first major step away from the hotel building, cryoto embracing, Souja Boys of the past. We'll have to wait and see!","pubDate":"2023-03-23 18:02:47","image_url":"https://asset.vg247.com/atari-nightdive-header.jpg/BROK/thumbnail/1200x630/atari-nightdive-header.jpg","id":"182d5351-0680-4e18-a959-a3c3fb4b3192"},{"title":"New AWE exhibits explore body issues, living matter, bridge art","link":"https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/new-awe-exhibits-explore-body-issues-living-matter-bridge-art","description":"Article content From a wall of guts to bacterial b","content":"Article content From a wall of guts to bacterial blooms to a building facade, you’ll find plenty to appreciate in three dramatic new exhibitions that opened at Art Windsor-Essex this month. Article content There’s no missing the centrepiece of this installation by Windsor artist Catherine Hois: A massive, wall-sized sculpture of human organs. Measuring 15 feet wide and 10.5 feet tall, Pageant of the Vulnerable turns fabric and recycled materials into bodily structures that visitors are allowed get close to and touch. “It’s really incredible — and sort of gross,” said Jennifer Matotek, executive director of AWE. “(Hois) has made it super flesh-like. Some parts of it are softer, some parts of it are harder… It makes you very aware of your own body.” Hois has described the piece as part of her therapeutic process dealing with issues such as body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. Accompanying the organ wall is a setting called Heart House, which creepily recreates the living room of Hois’ childhood home — complete with a television. Article content Article content Visitors are encouraged to sit and watch a stop-motion creature film made by Hois that also carries themes of consumption and body insecurities. “You’re invited to inhabit the space,” Matotek said. “She’s created an immersive environment. It’d be one thing to just show the animation — but her choice was to situate it in a house. There’s an ambience that provides an interesting context.” The exhibit is viewable until May 28. Plenty of artworks at AWE have been described as lively — but how about pieces that are actually living? This exhibition gathers the works of 18 Canadian women artists with a unifying theme of exploring organic matters and life processes. Some of those explorations have resulted in putting actual ecosystems in the gallery. Article content For example, artist Lisa Hirmer’s contribution is a geodesic dome that houses living, oxygen-producing plants. Artist Nicole Clouston put dirt samples into plexiglass containers and fed them bacteria — making blooms that will alter in colour over time. Similarly, artist Maria Simmons collected materials from around the gallery itself and contained them with visibly reactive chemicals. “Over the course of the exhibition — which is up to Oct. 1 — some of these pieces will grow and change,” Matotek noted. Matotek said artist Jennifer Willett, whose work is a part of the exhibition, has deep experience with biological media in art and helped AWE with a safe containment plan for the show. Recommended from Editorial Article content This exhibition by artist Sara Graham offers insight into the large-scale work she was commissioned to create for a building facade that’s part of the future Gordie Howe International Bridge. Taking a multi-disciplinary approach, Graham drew from architecture, historical mapping, urban planning, and her own travels around the city to come up with her designs. A scaled-down foam version of the building facade can be viewed in the exhibition, which is supported by the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority. “The display is very much connected with the bridge project,” Matotek explained. “(Graham) has recreated her studio wall, which shows a lot of the inspiration, research, and process behind the design for the facade.” The exhibit is viewable until May 28. Art Windsor-Essex (401 Riverside Dr. West) is open Tuesday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sundays from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $10 for the general public, free for AWE members and children under 6.

The post Fraud Alert: Goku Has Never Actually Beaten Vegeta appeared first on Kotaku Australia.","content":"Yesterday, I came across a viral post from a Dragon Ball Z fan account called Dragon Ball Perfect Shots showcasing Vegeta’s victory over Goku in the after-credit scene in the new film Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero . In Vegeta and Goku’s cinematic fight, which served as the B-plot of the film, the all-powerful saiyans had an exhibition match where they weren’t allowed to power up. Vegeta won. Read More: Everything We Loved About Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero While many fans consider this to be the first time Goku has lost to Vegeta, it’s actually the opposite. You see, Vegeta has never lost a fight against Goku. This was Vegeta fans’ Super-Bowl https://t.co/jSDw5puWu8 In this KotakuTalk, I will be exploring each of Goku and Vegeta’s fights to explain how the DBZ community has suffered at the hands of a widespread misconception that Vegeta, my short prince, has ever taken an L from Goku in the two times they’ve fought. The first battle Goku and Vegeta had was in the Saiyan Arc . In it, Vegeta and his lackey, Nappa, came to Earth to use the dragon balls to grant themselves immortality. After the death of many of Goku’s allies and Vegeta’s team killing of Nappa, Goku and Vegeta finally squared off. Read More: This Stunning Dragon Ball Fan Film Finally Gives Vegeta His Due The two threw Earth-rattling blows in an ebb-and-flow match-up. Goku, as many remember, gained a clear advantage by using his kaioken power-up and arbitrarily multiplying his output. However, the damage kaioken inflicted on Goku’s muscles, along with Vegeta crushing Goku in his Ozaru form, resulted in Goku not being able to continue their fight. On Planet Vegeta, we tech those , but for whatever reason, the fact of Vegeta’s victory gets lost in translation and turned into a Vegeta L because he gets jumped by Gohan, Krillin, and Yajirobe, and flees Earth. His tactical retreat was interestingly co-signed by Goku because he wanted the chance to fight Vegeta again. During the first quarter of the Majin Buu arc , Vegeta and Goku had their second fight. Prior to their battle, Vegeta “heel turned” on the Z-fighters by purposely allowing a villain named Babidi to transform him into Majin Vegeta . In theory, this transformation was meant to put Vegeta under Babidi’s control but in actuality, Vegeta used it as a means to get a power-up and force Goku to fight him before his time on earth expired (it’s a long story). Basically, all you need to know is that Vegeta has an “M” on his forehead and he’s still got that dog in him . Read More: Every Dragon Ball Movie, Ranked From Worst To Best The pair’s face-off in a rocky wasteland is, in all honesty, better experienced through the anime than the manga since Toei Animation added its own anime-only beats to the source material’s brief battle. But regardless of how you experience the fight, the outcome is the same. In the end, Goku and Vegeta postpone their bout to help their friends battle Majin Buu–but not before Vegeta knocks Goku out and goes into the fight alone. Classic Vegeta. He dies after this, btw. The majority of Dragon Ball Z fights run on wrestling rules that aim to protect the franchise’s biggest stars from character-defining losses. For example, big-money matches between fan favourites like Piccolo and Vegeta have never happened in the entirety of the series despite fan interest in discovering which of the two is stronger. My theory for why they haven’t fought is to generate hype over a “what-if” scenario between the two that creator Akira Toriyama and Toei Animation can pull the trigger on in a future manga chapter or movie. In that same vein, the creators have occasionally created top-billing “twice in a lifetime” matches between Goku and Vegeta only to throw shenanigans into the mix to protect their characters’ mystique. Sometimes a nail-biting fight ends because of outside interference, the sudden presence of a bigger threat — leading to an impromptu team-up — or a good old-fashioned draw. These kinds of inconclusive battles happen a lot in anime. Okay this one is admittedly self indulgent. pic.twitter.com/mpd77uKzZQ And Goku fans, possibly seeing what they want to see, have used some of these scenarios to reinforce the idea that their poster boy hero has at times emerged victorious. To their credit, DBZ ’s power creep and incessant need to create a new form for Goku while occasionally throwing Vegeta a few of his own would lead anyone to believe Goku has more W’s under his weighted clothes than he actually does. If we’re counting the filler Dragon Ball Super fight (which we shouldn’t) where Goku defeated Duplicate Vegeta , then sure, Goku technically beat “Vegeta” once. But as far as the official record shows, Vegeta is still undefeated.","pubDate":"2023-03-23 17:45:00","image_url":"https://www.kotaku.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/24/672756f6a142105c1372e89ce2f81975.jpg?quality=80=1280,720","id":"ad35405e-e23b-48c6-8f30-edd6e21dc18b"},{"title":"Peaky Blinders review: Rambert Dance's spotlight on Thomas Shelby is simply stunning","link":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/theatre-news/peaky-blinders-review-rambert-dances-26545223","description":"Peaky Blinders: The Redemption of Thomas Shelby from Rambert Dance is at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff","content":"Peaky Blinders may have ended on TV but there's a new dance version of the hit BBC series and it's currently being played out on the Welsh stage. The performance, which has toured to the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff, starts with the anti-hero, First World War army tunneler Thomas Shelby, immersed in the horrors of the Great War as he, his companions - dead inside but still walking - and family carve out their places in the ganglands of 1920s Midlands. The theatricality from Rambert’s Artistic Director, Benoit Swan Pouffer, and Peaky Blinders writer, Steven Knight, is stunning. The Moi Tran designed stage allows for multi levels of activity, including a trench that continues the theme of the war throughout the show, as bodies fall into it, dancers glide along it, and rise from it – all wonderful. Add strobe lighting and pyrotechnics to create the industrial heartland, and seamless scene changes from opium dens to speakeasys, factories to a fairground and racecourse.

Thomas Shelby, played by Joseph Kudra, swaggers as he cuts his way to the top of the dark side of town until tragedy reduces him to a drug destroyed wreck. The show belongs both to the dancers, Kudra in the title role, a lithe Seren Williams as the oh so seductive Grace, powerful women Caiti Carpenter as Polly to name just some, and the band. They play a combination of creations from composer Roman Gianarthur, heavily rhythmic guitar, strong percussion, and wonderfully evocative singing. We also have songs from Radiohead, Anna Calvi, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Nick Cave. Caps off to Yaron Engler, James Douglas and The Last Morrell.

The post The Mandalorian Finally Honours Star Wars’ Most Unfairly Abused Actor appeared first on Kotaku Australia.","content":"On the newest episode of Disney+’s The Mandalorian , a cool Jedi appeared to save the day in a short but awesome flashback. However, what really made this sequence so memorable and exciting was that finally, after over two decades, the man who played the widely reviled prequel CG character Jar Jar Binks finally got his chance to do something cool in Star Wars . Before we go any further, a warning that below you’ll find spoilers for both The Mandalorian ’s latest season and episode. Don’t say I didn’t warn you! Last night, I settled in on my couch to watch the latest episode of The Mandalorian ’s third season. What wild adventures would Baby Yoda and Space Daddy Mando get into this week, I wondered. And while I enjoyed the episode’s main plot — which featured a massive flying alien dino-thing and a lot of Mandalorian warriors — episode 20’s clear standout was a flashback sequence. Not just because it was cool and revealed more of Grogu’s past, which it did, but because it also starred Jar Jar Binks actor Ahmed Best as badass Jedi Master Kelleran Beq . However, don’t get it twisted and assume this was the first time Best has appeared as Master Beq in Star Wars . No, this is actually the second time Best has played this particular Jedi, though the first time was in a very different context: Best played Beq as the host of a Star Wars game show. Let me explain. During the events of episode 20, Bo-Kotan, Mando, and some members of his cult/family go off after a large monster that has absconded with a child. In the meantime, Baby Yoda aka Grogu stays behind, too young to go on such a dangerous hunt. While he waits around for daddy to return, the leader of the group makes him some more armour and during this process, all the banging metal, liquid steel, and loud machinery triggers a memory in Grogu. Specifically, he seems to remember more of how he survived Palpatine’s genocidal Order 66 . We’d seen a hint of this before, but last night it was finally time to learn what happened. And it turns out Jedi Master Kelleran himself saved Grogu , as seen in a very cool action scene involving dual lightsabers, speeder bikes, and even the Naboo Royal Guard. While we have to wait to see what happens next, I can explain who Kelleran Beq is. The Jedi Master, played by Best, first appeared in the 2019 Disney+ game show Star Wars: Jedi Temple Challenge . He was the host of the whole thing and in canon, this wasn’t a game show but a way to test young Jedi. It’s kind of weird. Anyway, at the time it was cool to see Ahmed Best get to return to Star Wars as a Jedi. And while Beq doesn’t get to do much during the game show’s episodes, it was still a wonderful moment for Best after all the shit he went through playing Jar Jar Binks. In 1999, in his first big film role ever, 25-year-old Ahmed Best played alien sidekick Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace . And, as you probably know, the character didn’t do well with adult fans and critics at the time. (As a 9-year-old kid, I enjoyed Binks!) But many people didn’t just hate Binks, they loathed the character and would often harass and taunt Best over his role performing Jar Jar. “I had death threats through the internet,” Best told Wired in 2017 . “I had people come to me and say, ‘You destroyed my childhood.’ That’s difficult for a 25-year-old to hear.” In fact, Best eventually admitted on social media that at one point during the worst of it all he considered suicide . And let’s be clear: You don’t have to like Jar Jar. But the bullshit Best got for the character was wrong and is a great reminder that real people make the things you love and hate. Thankfully, Best has moved on from Jar Jar, and has a wonderful family and a solid career. Still, I and many others wanted Best to come back to Star Wars in a big way. Sure, the hosting gig on his game show was neat. But I wanted more. Best deserved it. Jedi Kelleran Beq. Chapter 20 of #TheMandalorian is now streaming on @DisneyPlus . pic.twitter.com/Vs3tZl8u5U So you can imagine how pumped I was last night when Grogu ended up being saved by Best’s Jedi character. It took 20 years of abuse and harassment. 20 years of suffering. He had to go through so much. He wanted to end it all, even. But finally, in 2023, Ahmed Best got to portray a badass Jedi Master, wielding two lightsabers and fighting off Clone Troopers without breaking a sweat. Not only that, he was saving Grogu, a new beloved character who, in a different timeline, could just as easily have ended up as the next Jar Jar. It almost feels like Best is, in a meta way, saving Grogu from a similar fate to what he suffered over two decades ago. I assume we will see more of Best’s Jedi in a future episode of the show. There are still plenty of unanswered questions surrounding Grogu. But whatever. For now, I’m just happy that Ahmed Best finally got to escape the shadow of Jar Jar. Dude deserved this moment.","pubDate":"2023-03-23 17:40:00","image_url":"https://www.kotaku.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/24/fd6c8895a26f6021cea54a49127e0369.jpg?quality=80=1280,720","id":"deeb2d73-aaf0-4d09-a09c-92bc2bba5462"},{"title":"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum will sneak onto PC and consoles in May","link":"https://www.vg247.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-release-date-1","description":"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has a release date set for May 25 on PC and consoles.","content":"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has a release date, and you can expect a look at some gameplay via a showcase later today.\n\nReleasing on May 25, Gollum tells the tale of the twisted Stoor with a split-personality, who searched high and low for his Precious, until he finally found it and met his end.\n\nStory trailer for The Lord of the Ring: Gollum\n\nThe game tells of his experiences from behind the scenes in the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring.

The 79-year-old also calls himself “a non-popular, non-profit artist” - terms that are certainly not thrown around for the sake of modesty or humility.","content":"Sung Neung-kyung, an early champion of conceptual and performance art in Korea who pioneered the genre during the politically turbulent 1970s and 1980s / Courtesy of the artist and Lehmann Maupin, New York, Hong Kong, Seoul and London Sung Neung-kyung in limelight as 1970s Korean experimental art gains attention By Park Han-sol For most of his 55-year career, Sung Neung-kyung has been viewed as an outsider by the Korean art world. The 79-year-old also call himself \"a non-popular, non-profit artist\" ― terms that are certainly not thrown around for the sake of modesty or humility. As a creator who unyieldingly focused on the marginal genre of combining conceptual art and performance during the politically turbulent 1970s and 1980s, he was only invited to hold five solo exhibitions. And he didn't sell his first art piece until 2009. That's why it feels all the more surreal to Sung as he prepares himself for not just one, but five new solo shows for this year alone ― including his first in New York. He has also been named one of the early experimental trailblazers who will be highlighted at the upcoming group exhibition, \"Only the Young: Experimental Art in South Korea, 1960s-1970s,\" as it tours the Guggenheim in New York in September and the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles early next year. What's more, blue-chip American gallery Lehmann Maupin recently announced that it will represent Sung and went on to showcase the conceptual artist's historical work at Art Basel Hong Kong. \"It's like watching a flower blossom from a withered tree,\" he said as he described the experience of being thrust into the international spotlight in his golden years. \"If I were to guess, this is the result of me being an artist who has persistently walked down the same path throughout his lifetime. But it could also be part of the global art world's desire to witness how conceptualism ― which originated in the West in the 1960s ― has been interpreted and practiced by Korean creatives since we have long been overshadowed by our Chinese or Japanese counterparts.\" Sung's remark came last month in time for the opening of his sixth-ever solo show, \"As If Nothing … The Artistic Meandering of Sung Neung Kyung,\" currently mounted at Baik Art in central Seoul. Sung Neung-kyung's \"Contraction and Expansion\" (1976) / Courtesy of the artist, Baik Art While the conceptual artist started his career in the late 1960s, he regards the year 1973 as the decisive turning point, shortly after his military discharge. The Korean art scene in the 1970s saw a dynamic mix of emerging genres and movements. This included the rise of \"dansaekhwa\" (monochrome paintings) and \"three-dimensional art,\" the latter of which often incorporated the likes of stones, glasses, steel plates and tree trunks to produce experimental sculptural installations. Sung was approached by Lee Kun-yong, one of the country's early champions of experimental art, who asked him to join the avant-garde collective he had formed called Space and Time (ST). And he did. In line with the dominant trend in the avant-garde scene at the time, he produced the three-dimensional artwork, \"Circumstances,\" consisting of a stainless steel sheet and two white rocks, for the second ST group show in 1973. However, as soon as his piece went on display, he wanted to sink through the floor with shame. \"It was a complete failure that was just trying to imitate what was in fashion,\" he recalled. \"With three-dimensional art, I felt like I couldn't ever produce something that was groundbreaking or original.\" He had to go on a search to discover his own language. And he found the answer in conceptualism, which aimed to shed \"materiality\" in art. \"In fine arts, materiality is usually interconnected with how much the work is valued since it is the physical item that is being sold and purchased,\" Sung noted. \"I wanted to eliminate such an aesthetic or material concern from my piece, and when I did that, all I was left with was art as an idea, a piece of information.\" Installation view of Sung Neung-kyung's \"Venue 3\" series (1980) at Baik Art in central Seoul / Courtesy of Baik Art With this realization, he was now tasked with presenting his own answer to \"what is then conceptual art and what can it do?\" In 1974, he unveiled what turned out to be his magnum opus, \"Newspapers: From June 1, 1974, On.\" Every day for the duration of the weeklong group exhibition, he would pick up the newly delivered newspaper and cut out all blocks of printed text with a razor blade, leaving only the blank margins, images and advertisements. He would attach the tattered pages to a gallery wall, while dumping the cut-out portions of texts in acrylic boxes nearby. The whole act was a tacit yet striking commentary on the authoritarian government of Park Chung-hee as the artist crudely mimicked the process of state-led censorship of news media. According to Sung's own words, it was \"a silent protest\" against the country's political climate and the eroding freedom of expression. His conceptual oeuvre soon came to be defined as the mix of ephemerals such as newspapers and photographs with genre-defying performance. For his performances, he once again freed himself from material concerns as he used his own body and physical gestures as the central artistic tool. \"Self-exaggeration, excessive noise and disorder are often key elements of his performances,\" according to Lehmann Maupin. He would recite the ancestral rite prayers written on the paper fan and burn it afterward; stretch out his limbs like a fatigued figure skater; strip off everything save for his underpants; do hula hooping while shooting ping-pong balls at the audience with a slingshot; cover his whole face with shaving cream; count money from his pocket ― all chaotically performed in different sequences each time. By deliberately disrupting the white cube space of a gallery or a museum with everyday behaviors taken out of context, he questions ― and further dethrones ― the supposed symbols of power and authority in the art world. Sung Neung-kyung's \"Aluminum-Foil Man\" (2001) / Courtesy of the artist, Baik Art Sung carried on with his practice ― despite the criticism he received from a number of his fellow artists who viewed conceptual art to be \"superficial,\" especially in comparison to dansaekhwa or three-dimensional art that takes its cue from the profound, centuries-old Asian and Buddhist philosophy. His persistence even lasted throughout the 1980s when the Korean art scene was struck by the wind of change called Minjung Art, a socio-political movement that rose as a response to a series of pro-democracy protests against the military administration of Chun Doo-hwan. \"To those in the Minjung Art circle, my conceptual works lacked overt political statements or engagement that they espoused at the time,\" Sung said. Once again, his oeuvre was relegated to the fringes, away from the mainstream. It wasn't until the beginning of the 21st century that his works began to be slowly revisited in the art circle. This eventually led to his first-ever retrospective at the present-day Arko Art Center in 2001. Sung Neung-kyung's \"Drawings by Your Bottom\" series (2020) / Courtesy of the artist, Baik Art Twenty years later, Sung is still producing art that is just as rebellious and provocative in its own right. On view at Baik Art is his latest series, \"Drawings by Your Bottom,\" in which the artist takes photos of his urine-stained toilet paper every morning with his smartphone and adds flashy color filters. But when looking at the snapshots without this background information in mind, they are surprisingly reminiscent of infrared satellite map images of obscure islands. And during the opening ceremony of the exhibition at the gallery last month, the 79-year-old, without fail, presented his signature performance. He started the routine by doing freehand exercises and eventually stripped off until he was left with just a shower cap, swimming trunks and a pair of goggles. \"My performance lacks substance!\" he shouted. \"Be gone, substance! Let only the surface remain!\" Sung Neung-kyung presents his signature performance at the opening ceremony of his sixth-ever solo exhibition, \"As If Nothing … The Artistic Meandering of Sung Neung Kyung,\" at Baik Art, Feb. 22. Courtesy of Baik Art The bit ended with the artist removing the sheets of aluminum foil that were covering all of his art pieces with audience members. These metallic sheets ― partially recalling his 2001 performance piece, \"Aluminum-Foil Man,\" where he wrapped his body in shiny swaths of foil and performed absurd martial arts moves ― urge the audience to approach art more critically instead of blindly consuming what is shown before their eyes, according to Sung. Although the sheets are no longer there, his message still resonates throughout the gallery. \"You know, playing on the fringes of the art world has actually been quite fun. I've been telling my fellow creatives that they don't always need to gravitate toward whatever lies at the center. Being on the periphery doesn't mean the end of the world.\" \"As If Nothing … The Artistic Meandering of Sung Neung Kyung\" runs through April 30 at Baik Art.

Once out in the world, she befriends Bonnie Hunt (Kate Hudson), a local stripper and single mother. \"It was liberating to star alongside Hollywood actors. Because music plays an important role in our movie, there was always a big speaker on set playing punk music. We were all in a festive mood,\" she said in a written interview released by distributor Pan Cinema, Wednesday. Her audition process was rigorous, with Jeon going a week without sleep to prepare for the audition. \"I submitted an audition tape and was cast without any in-person meeting. I had to join the cast right after I finished filming 'The Call,' so there was a lot of anxiousness. I flew to the U.S. to meet director Ana Lily Amirpour. I stayed at her place for two nights and we discussed the film,\" she said. \"After meeting everybody on set and watching the way they worked and how chill they were, it kind of eased all of my worries and my nervousness.\" Actress Jeon Jong-seo / Courtesy of ANDMARQ Jeon described her character Mona as the most innocent character she has played so far. The actress made her debut in auteur Lee Chang-dong's thriller \"Burning\" (2018). Since then, she has appeared in the Netflix series \"Money Heist: Korea ― Joint Economic Area\" and tvN's \"Bargain.\" \"Mona has supernatural powers, but I felt she was more like a newborn baby taking her first step out into the world. She sees what others don't see and feels what others cannot feel,\" she said. Jeon went on to talk about shooting the film in the exotic setting of nighttime New Orleans. \"The weather in New Orleans is very unpredictable. The city is a mecca for jazz lovers. I haven't been to many countries, but it was by far the most exciting and memorable place. I think the atmosphere of New Orleans is well captured in the film,\" she said. \"Mona Lisa and the Blood Moon\" had its world premiere at the 78th Venice International Film Festival in 2021.

The user wrote that the father saw the actor and his friends getting ready to ride a bicycle one day and tried to talk to them. When he asked Yoo if one of the bicycles was his, Yoo got upset and said, \"Would I ride that crappy bicycle?

Like the summer-bastard wasps that it’s named after, the show attacks you with brutal sting after brutal sting leaving you no time to recover before circling and striking again. In just the first episode of the second season, which begins streaming tonight on Neon and screening on SoHo on Monday, the show hits you with a bloody stabbing, some old-fashioned extortion, violent electric-shock therapy, rough but consensual sex, a murder cover-up, an animal-masked death cult and a poor sod being buried alive before wrapping things up with some cannibalism to lead into the end credits. It’s certainly flying straight at your viewing jugular. Which is a good thing. Season one was the breakout show of last year, winning stacks of awards and being nominated for seven Emmys. Which, yes, is an unusual amount of praise for a survival horror/murder mystery series with strong paranormal overtones. It’s also unusual because the show is determinedly freakish, delighting in mining nightmares for material and soaking them in a grungy 90s music-video aesthetic. Juliette Lewis as Natalie and Christina Ricci as Misty in Yellowjackets. It gets away with it because in some ways it’s two distinct shows. To quickly recap, Yellowjackets is about the survivors of a girls’ soccer team whose plane crashes into the wilderness en route to a tournament. It cleverly splits itself into two timelines. First, we go back to the mid-90s, where we follow the teenagers fighting for their lives against a supremely hostile environment and, increasingly, each other before zooming forward to the present day with the now-adult women trying to cope with the untold actions of their survival and the associated trauma involved with that. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. The show flips between these dual timelines with confidence and flair, sometimes multiple times in a scene. It often uses these time jumps to mirror the past with the present or to explain certain character traits or behaviours. It’s an addictive and endlessly interesting format that allows the show to continue pushing forward, layer puzzling mystery on top of gruesome murders and keep things zipping along. Unlike other shows that teased out their secrets for years, twisting themselves into knots trying to keep viewers guessing until the big end reveal after several seasons only proved they’d been winging it the whole time, Yellowjackets moves with an assured purpose. It balances questions with answers in both timelines, while still leaving you dying to know what happens next. If the writers are as lost in the woods as their characters then they’re doing a bloody good job of not showing it. Melanie Lynskey in Yellowjackets, season 2. Photo / Supplied A lot of the hype has gone to our very own Melanie Lynskey, who expertly leads the ensemble as Shauna, a disenchanted housewife turned accidental murderer and crash survivor. She’s so believable as an exhausted mother yearning for the excitement and life that she felt while stranded in the woods, moving with the world on her shoulders and sizzling into life whenever things take a turn for a worse. Which they often do. She’s backed up by the always excellent Juliette Lewis, who riffs on her cool gal, rock n’ roll persona, Tawny Cypress, whose feral alter-ego has driven a blood-stained wedge between her and her family and the show’s MVP Christina Ricci, whose terrifying portrayal of Misty, a nerdy “citizen detective” with an endless capacity for violence, is unnervingly believable.

Simone Kessell joins the cast as the adult version of survivor Lottie. Her dark visions and prophecies as a teen in the woods lead her to establishing herself as a cult leader in the second season. The show has lost none of its bleak outlook, macabre imagery or black humour. For a show with as much awful, freaky stuff going on, it’s also very funny. After setting such high expectations last year, it’s a massive relief to be able to say that in its second season, Yellowjackets has lost none of its sting. As long as you can stomach the odd bit of cannibalism.

I’m not a person with a big resonant voice or a big presence.” This was on a weekend evening earlier this month at an upscale vegan restaurant. Lynskey, inconspicuous in a cobalt cardigan, was installed at a table in the far corner of the patio, eating as quietly as she could. (She has misophonia, specifically an aversion to “mouth noises”.) Polite almost to the point of pathology, she worried over whether to ask a manager to turn the music down and a heating lamp off. She speckled her conversation with minimisers: “kind of”, “sort of”, “a little”, “a bit”. After she waved at a busboy she recognised from another vegan eatery, she agonised over the possibility that he thought she was summoning him. Offscreen, Lynskey is a very nice lady. Unnervingly nice. Onscreen she specialises in a ferocious deconstruction of that same type. For the past decade, and particularly in the past couple of years, in shows like Yellowjackets and The Last of Us, she has embodied women who seem innocuous on the surface — breathy, meek, bland — only to reveal limitless anger and desire just beneath their suburban separates. (HBO show The Last of Us , on Neon, recently concluded its first season; Yellowjackets returns for its second on March 24 on Neon). Sitting opposite her, I was reminded of raptors I have seen and certain small, sharp-clawed mammals, with plumage and pelts so precisely matched to their surroundings that they seem to disappear. Until they strike. Lynskey understands the usefulness of this kind of camouflage. “I have been cast a few times as somebody who is supposed to surprise you,” she said, taking a sip of a spicy margarita. Then she put the margarita down, because she had another theory. Yes, her characters are surprising, but maybe almost any woman is surprising, deep down. “Maybe it’s just about unravelling the inner lives of women who are not usually examined,” Lynskey said. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Lynskey in the new season of Yellowjackets, which premieres on March 24. Lynskey, 45, born on the west coast of New Zealand, entered the industry early and somewhat by chance. She had always loved acting, which offered her a reprieve from what she described as an acute self-consciousness. But she had only ever done plays at school or church when a casting director for Peter Jackson’s Heavenly Creatures , a 1994 film inspired by a lurid murder case, came to her high school. Lynskey, who was 15 at the time, was cast opposite Kate Winslet, as a teenager who conspires to murder her own mother. She is thrilling in the role, with a scowl that burns through the celluloid and a dark, mordant energy. That predilection for women with turbulent inner lives, women who strain against social norms — it was there from the start.

After finishing high school and trying university in New Zealand, Lynskey moved first to London and then, in 2000, to Los Angeles, where she spent a decade playing anodyne supporting roles in mainstream films ( Sweet Home Alabama , Coyote Ugly ) and the occasional indie ( Shattered Glass ). Casting agents and her own representation saw her as the sister, the stepsister, the friend and, rather more vividly, as Charlie Sheen’s erotomaniac neighbour in Two and a Half Men. She was slender in those years, though not perhaps as slender as the industry prefers: The scripts she received were typically for “the fat friend or the jokey kind of fat person”, she recalled. “There was one thing I read where the person had a candy bar in every scene.” In her 20s, she was almost never seen as either the subject of her own story or an object of desire, which felt strange. She was shy, yes, but she wasn’t dull or unloved. “In my own life, I had a lot of romantic drama,” she said. “It was impossible for me to stay single.” The typecasting as wallflowers and frumps confused her. “It was kind of a strange disconnect,” she said. “I felt like I was pretending when I was going in and auditioning to play these dowdy people.” After two years as a series regular on Two and a Half Men , she asked to be downgraded to a recurring character in the hope that she might pursue more substantive roles. She wanted more time on camera - less for egotistical reasons than because she envied the actors who never sat down all day. And she wanted to give herself over to women with a few more facets. “She is drawn to complicated characters, flawed characters,” said actress and director Clea DuVall, Lynskey’s friend for 25 years. “She doesn’t want to just play one thing.” Advertisement Advertise with NZME. In her mid-30s, having finally changed agents, new roles came, often in independent films like Hello I Must be Going , Happy Christmas , Goodbye to All That and I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore , as well as in the HBO series Togetherness . The characters she played were struggling, adrift, deeply sad. To animate these roles, Lynskey began to engage in what she calls “dream work”. After reading a script she will write a letter to herself, asking for a dream. The next morning she records the dream and determines, in ways both practical and symbolic, how it might apply to the character. Beyond that she operates on instinct. “Somebody comes out of me,” is how she put it. When the process works, it feels like magic, she said. Lynskey’s characters often conceal profound anger and desire. “I have been cast a few times as somebody who is supposed to surprise you,” she said. Photo / Philip Cheung, The New York Times “She’s pulling from a place that’s deeper and bigger than anything that’s happening on camera,” Jay Duplass, a creator of Togetherness , told me. Duplass described her as a woman without emotional blocks. But for a long time, Lynskey contended with one particular block, an unwillingness to feel or express what she referred to, elliptically, as a lifelong anger. “It was a weakness in my performances, I was afraid to dip into it,” she said. Even after encounter therapy involving a foam dummy and a baseball bat and five years of psychodynamic group sessions, that fear remained. Then, in Toronto, where she was shooting the FX miniseries Mrs America , nursing her newborn daughter (Lynskey’s husband is actor Jason Ritter) and half-crazed with exhaustion, she received the script for Yellowjackets . Its pull was undeniable. Yellowjackets is set in two different decades: in the 1990s, when a plane carrying a girls’ high school soccer team crashes in the Canadian wilderness, and in the present as the survivors stare down past and present traumas. Lynskey was being offered the part of Shauna, once a star student and now a restless New Jersey housewife. (Actress Sophie Nelisse plays the character as a teen.) The adult Shauna has few lines in the pilot, but Lynskey felt drawn to the character’s power and palpable discontent. Here, finally, was a part that demanded and would reward her anger. Also, as she realised later, she knew what it was like to experience a seismic event as a teenager — the making of Heavenly Creatures - and then return to her former life having to pretend that nothing much had changed. Making that movie had been a disruption not a trauma, but it meant that she could relate to some of what Shauna had gone through. Karyn Kusama, who directed the pilot episode, admired Lynskey’s approach to the character, which she described as both electric and raw. “She just lives in this simmering rage,” Kusama said, “a rage that is met halfway with helplessness.” The adult Shauna’s personality, as imagined by Lynskey, is a grab bag of contradictions and bad ideas. Underestimated, manipulative, impulsive, she’s as comfortable skinning a rabbit as she is defrosting a roast. Shauna embarks on an affair with a much younger artist, telling her husband that she’s busy with her book club. “I do think she’s very invested in seeming like a person that is not going to bother you,” Lynskey said of Shauna. But Shauna does bother other people - sometimes she bothers them right in a major artery. In The Last of Us, she played the murderous leader of a resistance movement. Photo / HBO Onscreen, Lynskey melds these incongruities into a single, terrifying personality. “One of her magic tricks is the common everywoman quality, how unassuming she is,” Juliette Lewis, a Yellowjackets co-star, said of Lynskey’s performance. “Yet she’ll be savage in her behaviour.” Lynskey brought a few of the same paradoxes to Kathleen, her character in the breakout HBO thriller The Last of Us . Kathleen is the flinty leader of a resistance movement, tough as tungsten nails. A typical line, delivered to an underling: “When you’re done, burn the bodies. It’s faster.” Another actress might have played Kathleen with explicit viciousness. Lynskey pitched a different attack, believing Kathleen should be more delicate, less self-reliant — “fluttery” was the word Lynskey used. She recalled that Craig Mazin, one of the showrunners, reminded her that Kathleen was a child killer. She told him that she understood that. He gave her his blessing. The darker corners of the internet have not always been so understanding. Lynskey’s performances have been scrutinised on social media largely (and irrelevantly) because of her size, which remains smaller than that of the average American woman though greater than the Hollywood norm. Lynskey has complicated feelings about this. It’s a funny irony that Lynskey has proved her worth to the culture at large mostly by playing undervalued women. Photo / Philip Cheung, The New York Times “I very much want to be onscreen representing an interesting person who’s not paying attention to what her tummy looks like,” she said. But she is troubled by the misogyny, the callousness. And though she has an elegant way with a clapback, she wishes that her perfectly ordinary body wasn’t so unusual for prestige television. “If there were more people who look like me, then I wouldn’t have to talk about it as much,” she said. Still, even intermittent trolling hasn’t diminished her pleasure in roles that let her crack open the nice lady exterior and show the violence underneath it. She hasn’t been able to apply this ferocity to her own life. (Later, when that busboy entered her orbit, she apologised for having waved.) But she can play it all day, which she described as “real freedom”. It’s a funny irony that only through playing undervalued and overlooked women has Lynskey finally proved her worth to the culture at large. And she has shown why none of us should turn our backs on women like these. That nice lady? She might be holding a knife. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

In an interview published Wednesday, the “ West Wing ” creator told The New York Times that he had realized something was wrong when he started bumping into walls in November. After seeking help from his doctor, Sorkin said, he learned his blood pressure was so high that “You’re supposed to be dead.” “Mostly it was a loud wake-up call,” Sorkin told the outlet . “I thought I was one of those people who could eat whatever he wanted, smoke as much as he wanted, and it’s not going to affect me. Boy, was I wrong.” He had been in the middle of rewriting Alan Jay Lerner’s 1960 “Camelot” musical, which he’s updating for modern Broadway audiences, when the health scare hit. Sorkin, 61, had been a lifelong smoker — and never thought about quitting until then. Advertisement “It was just part of it, the way a pen was part of it,” he told the Times. “I don’t want to talk about it too much, because I’ll start to salivate.” Sorkin got his start in Hollywood after adapting his play “A Few Good Men” into an Oscar-nominated Tom Cruise vehicle in 1992. His “West Wing” series became a prestige TV mainstay at the turn of the millennium, and “ The Social Network ” earned him his first Oscar in 2011 . Aaron Sorkin quit smoking after his health scare. Jordan Strauss/Invision/Associated Press While reworking “Camelot” ahead of its clear deadline — the play opens April 13 on Broadway — he worried that the stroke may have impeded his creative abilities. Advertisement “There was a minute when I was concerned that I was never going to be able to write again,” Sorkin told the Times, “and I was concerned in the short-term that I wasn’t going to be able to continue writing ‘Camelot.’” The writer-turned-director ( who has now helmed three films ) was initially hesitant to speak out about his diagnosis when the Times approached him for an article on his project. Sorkin reassessed, however, after deciding on the public benefits of sharing his story. “If it’ll get one person to stop smoking,” Sorkin told the outlet, “then it’ll be helpful.” Sorkin said he has a substantial new medication regimen now and joked that people “can hear the pills rattling around in me.” But he also hopes that the industry doesn’t write him off just yet. “Let me make this very, very clear,” he told the Times. “I’m fine. I wouldn’t want anyone to think I can’t work. I’m fine.” Related Broadway Musicals stroke aaron sorkin Florence Pugh Puts Sexy Twist On Classic Suit And Tie At ‘A Good Person’ Premiere Keanu Reeves Can't Get Enough Of 'John Wick' Star Rina Sawayama's Acting Skills Sarah Snook Reveals She’s Pregnant With First Child At ‘Succession’ Premiere Go To Homepage Before You Go Marco Margaritoff Trends Reporter Suggest a correction You May Like","description":"“I thought I was one of those people who could eat whatever he wanted, smoke as much as he wanted,\" said the writer for stage and screen. \"Boy, was I wrong.”","id":"f3b532ee-670e-4456-95f2-0c957745ad7a","link":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/youre-supposed-to-be-dead-aaron-sorkin-discloses-recent-stroke-diagnosis_n_641c4124e4b01ea5cd92b934","pubDate":"2023-03-23 14:58:12","title":"'Supposed To Be Dead': Aaron Sorkin Reveals Recent Stroke Diagnosis"},{"content":"Newsreader Jon Snow talks fatherhood at 75 'His mum is very hands-on' (Image: Getty) SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
